It measures the extent to which these variables change together. \\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n - 1} \\] • Correlations are fully standardized Covariances • Regression Coefficients are partially standardized Covariances 1.2 Correlations In bivariate distribution, we may be interested to find out if there is any correlation or covariation between the two variables under study. If the change in one variable affects a change in the other variable, the variables are said to be correlated. 1.3 Directionality If the two variables deviate in the same direction i.e. if the increase (or decrease) in one results in a corresponding increase (or decrease) in the other, correlation is said to be direct or positive. If they constantly deviate in the opposite directions i.e. if increase (or decrease) in one results in corresponding decrease (or increase) in the other, correlation is said to be diverse or negative. 1.4 Correlations Example For example, the correlation between the heights and weights of a group of persons is positive and the correlation between price and demand of commodity is negative 1.5 Types of Correlations Pearson, Spearman and Kendall The Pearson product moment correlation assesses the degree of linear relationship between two quantitative variables. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient assesses the degree of relationship between two rank-ordered variables. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD Kendall’s tau is nonparametric measure of rank correlation. ======= Kendall’s tau is nonparametric measure of rank correlation. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; origin/master "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
